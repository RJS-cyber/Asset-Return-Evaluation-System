# Asset Return Evaluation System (ARES)
(German Version below)

# Design and Objectives
The Asset Return Evaluation System (ARES) is a Java-based analytical application designed to evaluate and compare the 
profitability of different financial assets over a user-defined investment horizon. The system enables users to model 
investment outcomes by specifying an initial capital amount, an investment duration in years, and one or more predefined 
asset classes. Based on these inputs, ARES calculates and visually presents the comparative performance of the selected assets.

The primary objective of this project is to provide a structured and intuitive tool for analyzing investment returns, 
while demonstrating fundamental software engineering concepts such as user input handling, financial computation, data 
visualization, and modular program design.

# Roadmap
- Phase 1: Backend Architecture & Error Handling
- Phase 2: RESTful API Implementation
- Phase 3: Frontend Implementation
- Phase 4: Data Visualization & Quality of Life
- Phase 5: UI Polish

# Scope and Limitations
This project is intended for academic and instructional purposes. It does not account for real-world market volatility, 
transaction costs, inflation, or risk factors beyond the simplified asset models. Consequently, the results produced by 
ARES should not be interpreted as financial advice.
